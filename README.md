# Run-Pascal-Script alone or with maXbox

The program shows how to run a Pascal script in Delphi, pass variables and types to a script. The whole process works asynchronously, in threads.

The following article summarizes an experience using RemObjects PascalScript to run scripts in Delphi: [My experience using RemObjects PascalScript to run scripts in Delphi.](https://www.clevercomponents.com/articles/article052/)

## How to compile
With maXbox there's a precompiled version available.  maXbox is a script tool engine, compiler and source lib all in one exe to design and code your scripts in a shellbook! Pure Code for Object Scripting. Principle is simplicity and reduce to the max.
The App is “out of the box” (self containment) and needs no installation nor registration. It has an independent system architecture (ISA).
Pas2js is an open source Pascal to JavaScript transpiler. It parses Object Pascal or maXbox files and emits JavaScript. It takes Delphi/Lazarus projects and modules (.DPR, .LPR, .PAS, .PP) and converts them to JavaScript (.JS).
